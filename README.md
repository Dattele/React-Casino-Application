# Casino Application

Welcome to the **Casino Application**! This project is now built using **React** and **SCSS (SASS)**. The landing page features multiple casino games, though currently, only **BlackJack** is fully functional.

## Features

### Landing Page
The landing page lists the following games:
- **BlackJack** (fully functional)
- **Roulette** (coming soon)
- **Texas Hold'em** (coming soon)
- **Slot Machines** (coming soon)

### BlackJack Game
The **BlackJack** game follows the standard rules:
- The player competes against a **CPU dealer**.
- The objective is to get as close as possible to **21** without exceeding it.
- The game includes:
  - **Hit** or **Stand** options for the player.
  - **Dealer logic**: The dealer automatically hits on 16 or lower and stands on 17 or higher.
